Allele - a version of a gene
Genotype - the allele of a gene that the cell, organism or individual has
Nucleotide - an individual element (A, T, G or C) of DNA (or RNA)
Chromosome - an organized structure of DNA, protein, and RNA found in cells
Locus - location of a gene or DNA sequence or position on a chromosome
Base Pair - is the building block of the DNA double helix. it is a pair of nucleotides.
SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) - a variation of a single base pair during copying
Mutation - a random change to one or more chromosomes or traits. this produces variation in the population
Variation - the result of mutation

Phenotype - the outcome of two combined allele
Heterozygous (hybrid) - two different alleles
Homozygous - two identical alleles

Dominance - indicates dominance of one gene over another (over simplified)
Recessive - opposite of Dominance
Incomplete Dominance - a non-mutually exclusive combination (red + white = pink)
Codominant - both alleles are expressed in the phenotype

Independant Assortment - two traits on separate chromosomes (can transmit individually)
Linked Traits - two traits on the same chromosome (must transmit together)

Meiosis - special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction
Homologous chromosome - a pair on chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father
Autosomal (autosome) - a chromosome that is not an allosome (gender chromosome)
y-chromosome - male chromosome
x-chromosome - female chromosome
Genetic Recombination - when genes are split, during the creation of sperm or egg, some chromosomes are shuffled around.
	the genes you pass on your offspring are NOT necessarily the same you inherited from your parents. most of the X and
	Y chromosomes remain intact

Genome - an entire set of chromosomes for an organizm. the human genome is made up of 46 (23 pairs) chromosomes and is
	composed of 3 billion base pairs.

Natural Selection - if a factor increases that one type of organism cannot handle, it will not be able to reproduce as
	readily leaving resources available to organisms (or mutations of the original organism) that can tolerate the
	increased factor
